## Run the Project

To start the project, run:

```sh
npm start
```

## Potential Improvements

- Redirect on Invalid Room: If the room does not exist (invalid data), I would implement a redirect to an error page.
- Shareable Room Links: I would add the ability to generate and copy a room link, similar to Google Meet, and include a button to share it on social media.
- UI/UX Enhancements: Some minor styling improvements to make the interface more polished.
- Additional Features: Implement all the remaining functionality mentioned in the task requirements.
- New Message Notifications: Add notifications for new messages if the user is in another browser tab or at the top of the chat.
- Currently, the backend returns the entire message list every time. I would like to initially load some messages and then receive new messages one by one.

## Time Spent:

I spent approximately 8 hours completing this task.
